S1="hello"
S2="world"
ns1=S2[0]+S1[1:]
ns2=S1[0]+S2[1:]
ns3=ns1+" "+ns2
print(ns3)


# Step 1: Start
# Step 2: Create string S1
# Step 3: Create string S2
# Step 4: Create ns1 by concatenating the first character of S2 with the substring of S1 starting from index 1
# Step 5: Create ns2 by concatenating the first character of S1 with the substring of S2 starting from index 1
# Step 6: Concatenate ns1 and ns2 with a space in between to create ns3
# Step 7: Print ns3
# Step 8: Stop
